# Radio (Event Manager for Golang)

Radio is a small framework for managing an event base system on application level.

If you have an application which is base on events which are fired, and you have to react on that, this should fit the
best for you. It will help you a bit when having a lot of channels and passing a lot of data to your goroutines.

Please feel free to enhance the framework by contributing. (Just fork it and make a PR!)

## Basic Concepts of the Framework

Understanding how it works is pretty simple.
